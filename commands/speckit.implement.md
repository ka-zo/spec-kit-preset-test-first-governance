# Test-First Implementation Wrapper

Apply these execution rules in addition to the core implementation workflow.

## Critical Execution Rules
- Do not write production code for a behavior slice until its required TDD and applicable ATDD/BDD executable evidence exists.
- Run the new evidence for the current slice before its production change and confirm it fails for the expected missing behavior. Record red-state evidence in task, PR, or CI output; write a persistent report only when the plan requires versioned retention.
- After the expected failure, update the artifact's Evidence Artifact Registry entry to `Red` with its evidence path.
- If a failure is unexpected, flaky, environment-caused, or product-breaking, create or update the corresponding `specs/<feature>/defect-log.md` entry instead of hiding it in task notes.
- Implement the smallest production change needed to pass the current slice's failing evidence.
- Rerun the slice evidence, update its registry entry to `Green`, and refactor while keeping the relevant suites green.
- Complete one Red-Green-Refactor cycle before adding executable evidence for the next slice; do not batch every failing test for the story before implementation.
- Run full TDD, all executable evidence mapped to required BDD/ATDD roles, coverage, linting, formatting, and every quality gate marked `Required` before marking the story complete.
- Update each executed artifact in the registry and each gate in Quality Gate Results to `Green` or `Blocked`; retain `N/A` only with its approved rationale and alternative evidence.
- Keep the Scenario Coverage Matrix current when scenarios, examples, sampling strategies, shared BDD/ATDD evidence, or source mappings change.
- Keep `defect-log.md` current for open, fixed, verified, rejected, and deferred defects.
- Keep `test-summary.md` current at story and feature completion with execution totals, coverage/traceability status, defect summary, risks/exceptions, evidence links, and Go/No-Go recommendation.
- Mark tasks `[X]` only after the relevant tests/gates have been executed and evidence paths exist.

## Failure Handling
If a test fails for an unexpected reason, stop the current story implementation and report:
- failing command;
- failing suite (`TDD`, `BDD`, `ATDD`, or gate);
- expected failure reason vs actual failure reason;
- file path and scenario/test ID;
- proposed fix;
- defect ID or rationale for not creating a defect entry.

{CORE_TEMPLATE}

## Additional Done Criteria
- [ ] Reproducible red-state evidence exists in the retention location declared by the plan
- [ ] All TDD tests pass and approved coverage thresholds are met without baseline regression
- [ ] All scenarios mapped to required BDD roles pass and have executable bindings
- [ ] All scenarios mapped to required ATDD roles pass and have executable bindings
- [ ] The Scenario Coverage Matrix covers every required behavior, acceptance boundary, edge/error condition, and approved example or sampling strategy
- [ ] Shared BDD/ATDD evidence uses one owning-suite execution route, provides both mapped roles, and records an equivalence rationale
- [ ] Every BDD/ATDD `N/A` remains justified and has alternative evidence
- [ ] Linting/formatting has zero blocking findings
- [ ] Every required static-analysis, security, and runtime-smoke gate passes
- [ ] Every gate `N/A` and threshold exception remains justified and approved
- [ ] `specs/<feature>/test-traceability.md` has no missing source mappings, dangling artifact IDs, duplicated execution fields, or stale registry/gate statuses
- [ ] `specs/<feature>/defect-log.md` reflects all unexpected failures, open defects, deferred defects, accepted risks, and verification closures
- [ ] `specs/<feature>/test-summary.md` reflects final execution, coverage, traceability, defect, risk, evidence, and recommendation status
