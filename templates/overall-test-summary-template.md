# Overall Test Summary Report: [PROJECT OR RELEASE NAME]

**Release / Build**: [version, release ID, commit SHA, or build ID]  
**Report Scope**: [project/release/milestone/date range]  
**Overall Summary Mode**: [rolling/release]  
**Release ID**: [N/A or release-id]  
**Output Path**: [reports/test-summary.md or reports/releases/<release-id>/test-summary.md]  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Last Updated**: [DATE]  
**Primary CI Evidence**: [CI run, artifact bundle, dashboard, or report index]

## Executive Summary

| Item | Result |
|------|--------|
| Overall Test Status | [Pass/Fail/Blocked/Conditional Pass] |
| Release Recommendation | [Go/No-Go/Conditional Go] |
| Features Included | [count and scope] |
| Features Excluded | [count and rationale] |
| Open Critical / High Defects | [count and links] |
| Approved Exceptions / Accepted Risks | [count and links] |
| Primary Evidence Location | [CI/artifact/report links] |

Summarize whether the project or release is ready, what evidence supports that decision, and which risks or exceptions remain.

## Destination Decision

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Overall summary mode | [rolling/release] | [rolling for latest aggregate status, release for versioned release evidence] |
| Release ID | [N/A or release-id] | [required when mode is release] |
| Output path | [reports/test-summary.md or reports/releases/<release-id>/test-summary.md] | [must match mode and release ID] |

Use `reports/test-summary.md` for a rolling/latest project summary. Use `reports/releases/<release-id>/test-summary.md` for versioned release evidence.

## Cross-Feature Risks and Exceptions

| ID | Source | Type | Description | Impact | Mitigation / Compensating Evidence | Owner | Expiry / Follow-up |
|----|--------|------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------|-------|--------------------|
| RISK-001 | [feature/report/gate] | [risk/threshold exception/deferred defect/N/A] | [description] | [impact] | [mitigation/evidence] | [owner] | [date/task] |

## Environment and Tooling

| Area | Value |
|------|-------|
| Runtime / Platform | [version] |
| Test Tools | [tools and versions] |
| Test Data | [fixtures, anonymized data, generated data, seed] |
| External Services | [mocked/real/service versions] |
| Build / Commit | [commit SHA, build ID, artifact version] |

## Release Recommendation

State the recommendation and rationale:

- **Go**: all included feature summaries are `Go` or justified `Conditional Go`, all required gates pass, no unaccepted Critical/High defects remain, and all exceptions are approved.
- **Conditional Go**: only approved, scoped exceptions remain with compensating evidence and follow-up.
- **No-Go**: any required evidence is missing, failed, stale, or blocked; or unaccepted Critical/High defects remain.

## Approvals

| Role | Name | Decision | Date | Notes |
|------|------|----------|------|-------|
| Engineering Owner | [name] | [Approved/Rejected/N/A] | [date] | [notes] |
| Product / Stakeholder Owner | [name] | [Approved/Rejected/N/A] | [date] | [notes] |
| Quality / Release Owner | [name] | [Approved/Rejected/N/A] | [date] | [notes] |

## Required Checks

- [ ] Every included feature links to current `test-summary.md`, `test-traceability.md`, and `defect-log.md` reports.
- [ ] Overall summary mode, release ID, and output path are declared and consistent.
- [ ] Aggregate execution totals match CI evidence and included feature summaries.
- [ ] Aggregate coverage, traceability, gate, defect, risk, and exception summaries match feature reports and CI artifacts.
- [ ] No overall defect, traceability, inventory, or execution report is duplicated unless an audit, regulatory, customer, or tool-integration requirement is declared.
- [ ] The release recommendation follows the stated Go / Conditional Go / No-Go policy.
