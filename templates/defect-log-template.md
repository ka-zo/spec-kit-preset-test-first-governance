# Defect Log: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature**: [link to spec.md]  
**Plan**: [link to plan.md]  
**Traceability**: [link to test-traceability.md]  
**Test Summary**: [link to test-summary.md]  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Last Updated**: [DATE]

## Purpose and Scope

Track defects, unexpected test failures, escaped issues, accepted risks, and verification evidence for this feature. Record only product, test, environment, or governance issues that affect feature readiness; routine implementation tasks belong in `tasks.md`.

## Status Vocabulary

- `Open`: confirmed issue without an implemented fix.
- `In Progress`: fix or investigation is underway.
- `Blocked`: progress needs an external decision, dependency, access, or environment change.
- `Fixed`: fix is implemented and awaiting verification.
- `Verified`: fix is confirmed by linked evidence.
- `Deferred`: accepted for later work with approval and compensating evidence.
- `Rejected`: triaged as not a defect, duplicate, or out of scope with rationale.

## Severity and Priority Policy

| Level | Severity Meaning | Priority Meaning |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Critical | Data loss, security exposure, unavailable core workflow, legal/compliance risk, or release-blocking safety issue | Must be resolved before release unless explicitly accepted by the accountable approver |
| High | Major user-visible failure, broken acceptance criterion, severe performance/accessibility failure, or high-risk regression | Resolve before release unless a documented exception exists |
| Medium | Partial workflow failure, workaround exists, non-critical quality gate failure, or localized regression | Resolve in the current release when practical or track as follow-up |
| Low | Cosmetic, documentation, low-risk maintainability, or minor non-blocking issue | Resolve opportunistically |

## Defect Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total defects | [count] | [scope] |
| Open Critical / High defects | [count] | Must be zero or explicitly accepted before release |
| Deferred defects | [count] | Must have approver, rationale, and follow-up |
| Reopened defects | [count] | [trend/risk] |
| Escaped defects | [count] | Issues found after the intended verification stage |

## Required Checks

- [ ] Every unexpected failing test or gate has a defect entry or documented non-defect rationale.
- [ ] Every Critical or High defect is `Verified`, `Rejected`, or explicitly accepted with approver, rationale, compensating evidence, and follow-up.
- [ ] Every deferred defect has scope, owner, target follow-up, and risk acceptance.
- [ ] Every fixed defect links to verification evidence in `test-traceability.md` or CI artifacts.
- [ ] Defect counts and release-impact decisions match `test-summary.md`.
