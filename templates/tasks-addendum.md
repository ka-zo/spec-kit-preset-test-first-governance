## Mandatory Test-First Task Rules *(overrides any optional-test wording)*

Tests are **mandatory** for every feature. If any lower-priority or core template says tests are optional, this preset supersedes that wording. Create coverage-complete TDD tasks for production logic, covering every required TDD inventory item rather than a minimum count. Create coverage-complete, non-duplicative scenario tasks needed to cover every `Required` BDD and ATDD evidence role; preserve justified `N/A` decisions instead of creating ceremonial scenarios.

### Core-Compatible Task Format
Every task MUST keep the core Spec Kit checkbox, task ID, parallel marker, and `[US#]` story-label format. For test and gate tasks, place the owning-suite marker as the first token of the description.

```text
- [ ] T### [P?] [US#?] [TDD|BDD|ATDD|GATE] Description with exact file path
```

Rules:
- `[TDD]`, `[BDD]`, `[ATDD]`, and `[GATE]` extend the task description; they do not replace or alter core `T###`, `[P]`, or `[US1]` identifiers.
- The suite label identifies the artifact's primary owner; it does not claim that TDD, BDD, and ATDD are mutually exclusive test types.
- If one artifact supplies multiple evidence roles, use its owning-suite label and record the roles once in the Evidence Artifact Registry plus the relevant source relationships in the Source Coverage Map.
- Never create duplicate test tasks solely to represent the same evidence under another suite label.
- A `Required` BDD or ATDD role does not require a task with that suite label when an artifact owned by another suite fully provides the required evidence and traceability records why the behavior example and acceptance boundary are equivalent.
- `[TDD]` is required for unit, component, integration, contract, property, boundary, negative, mutation, or implementation-level test tasks.
- `[BDD]` is required for Gherkin behavior feature files, step definitions, behavior fixtures, and BDD runner/report tasks.
- `[ATDD]` is required for acceptance Gherkin feature files, acceptance step definitions, and system/e2e acceptance fixtures.
- `[GATE]` is allowed only for non-product quality gates such as traceability maintenance, lint, formatting, static analysis, security validation, dependency audit, coverage aggregation, applicable runtime smoke, and evidence publishing. Each `[GATE]` task MUST state which suite outputs or governance artifact it protects.
- Production implementation tasks SHOULD NOT use a suite label unless the task directly modifies test code.

### Required Phase Shape Per User Story
Within each user story phase:

1. **Scenario specification** — create a coverage-complete, non-duplicative set of scenarios that covers all required ATDD acceptance and BDD behavior evidence roles before production implementation begins.
2. **Traceability planning update** — add artifact definitions to the Evidence Artifact Registry, source relationships to the Source Coverage Map, and scenario/example rows to the Scenario Coverage Matrix in `specs/<feature>/test-traceability.md`.
3. **Incremental behavior cycles** — divide the story into the smallest meaningful slices that can be independently verified. For each slice, tasks MUST appear in this order:
   1. **Executable evidence** — add only the ATDD/BDD bindings and TDD tests needed for the current slice.
   2. **Expected failure checkpoint** — run the new evidence, confirm it fails for the intended missing behavior, and record `Red`.
   3. **Minimal implementation** — add only the production code needed to make the current slice pass.
   4. **Passing checkpoint** — rerun the slice evidence and record `Green`.
   5. **Refactor** — improve the design and rerun the relevant evidence while it remains green.
4. **Repeat** — complete the cycle before adding executable evidence for the next slice; do not accumulate all failing tests for the story before any production implementation.
5. **Story validation checkpoint** — after all slices are green, run TDD and all executable evidence mapped to required BDD/ATDD roles, plus coverage, linting, formatting, and every gate marked `Required`.
6. **Traceability result update** — record final artifact results in the registry and gate results in Quality Gate Results.

Shared bindings, fixtures, or helpers MUST be created once under `tests/support/` (or the selected equivalent) and referenced by each consuming suite.

When BDD or ATDD is `N/A`, add no tasks for that practice. The story's tasks MUST reference the recorded rationale and alternative evidence; task generation MUST report a blocking gap if the rationale is missing or contradicted by the story.

Task generation MUST create distinct scenario or scenario-outline-example tasks when different FRs, SCs, ECs, input classes, externally visible option combinations, interfaces, outcomes, or error messages need distinct evidence. Scenario outlines MUST enumerate all required examples or include a task to record the approved sampling strategy in `specs/<feature>/test-traceability.md`.

Task generation MUST also create distinct `[TDD]` test tasks for each required implementation-level behavior in the TDD Test Inventory. Do not stop after one happy-path and one negative-path task when additional boundaries, invalid inputs, state transitions, integration contracts, or expected error sources need separate evidence.

### Required Example Tasks Per Story
Use the applicable lines from this example, adapted to the selected stack. The example uses distinct scenarios because its acceptance and behavior evidence differ. When one scenario fully satisfies both roles, keep only its owning-suite tasks and record both roles in traceability.
Add as many behavior slices and `[TDD]` tasks as the TDD Test Inventory requires; the sample below is illustrative, not a maximum or minimum count.

### Global Quality Gate Tasks
The final phase MUST include:
- `[GATE]` coverage aggregation for TDD and changed production code.
- `[GATE]` evidence report confirming 100% of scenarios mapped to required BDD and ATDD roles pass; reuse one owning-suite result when a scenario supplies both roles.
- `[GATE]` scenario coverage matrix review proving every required behavior, acceptance boundary, edge/error condition, and approved example or sampling strategy is represented.
- `[GATE]` linting and formatting checks for source and tests.
- `[GATE]` required static analysis or type checking for source and tests.
- `[GATE]` required security and runtime smoke validation where applicable.
- `[GATE]` traceability review proving all FR/SC/US/EC IDs map to registered artifacts whose current statuses and evidence are stored once in their registry entries.
