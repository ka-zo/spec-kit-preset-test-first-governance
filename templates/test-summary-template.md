## Environment and Tooling

| Area | Value |
|------|-------|
| Runtime / Platform | [version] |

| Test Data | [fixtures, anonymized data, generated data, seed] |
| External Services | [mocked/real/service versions] |
| Build / Commit | [commit SHA, build ID, artifact version] |

## Release Recommendation

State the recommendation and rationale:

- **Go**: all required evidence is Green, no blocking defects remain, and exceptions are approved.
- **Conditional Go**: only approved, scoped exceptions remain with compensating evidence and follow-up.
- **No-Go**: required evidence is missing, failed, stale, or blocked; or unaccepted Critical/High defects remain.

## Approvals

| Role | Name | Decision | Date | Notes |
|------|------|----------|------|-------|
| Engineering Owner | [name] | [Approved/Rejected/N/A] | [date] | [notes] |
| Product / Stakeholder Owner | [name] | [Approved/Rejected/N/A] | [date] | [notes] |
| Quality / Release Owner | [name] | [Approved/Rejected/N/A] | [date] | [notes] |

## Required Checks

- [ ] Test plan, traceability, defect log, and raw evidence links are present.
- [ ] Every required TDD, BDD, ATDD, and quality-gate result is summarized with evidence.
- [ ] Coverage, scenario, and source-mapping summaries match `test-traceability.md`.
- [ ] Defect counts and release-impact decisions match `defect-log.md`.
- [ ] Every exception has scope, owner, rationale, compensating evidence, and follow-up or expiry.
- [ ] The release recommendation follows the stated Go / Conditional Go / No-Go policy.
